## v1.0.0 🎉
*Released on 2024-07-13T09:28:15Z*

- enhanced tag search
    - **nested tags / tag hierarchy:** this feature request has been [floating](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/gsoc-idea-hierarchical-tags/6335) [around](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/plugin-request-tags-hierarchy/14132) for [some time](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/managing-lots-of-notes/15153). when using nested tags like `#parent/child`, searching for `#parent` will bring up all its child tags as well (including `#parent/child`, `#parent/child2`, etc.). this format / style is common in many note apps such as [Bear](https://bear.app/faq/how-to-use-tags-in-bear/#nested-tags), [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags#Nested+tags), [Notable](https://notable.app/#more-features), [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/614), [Amplenote](https://www.amplenote.com/help/organizing_notes_tags#How_do_nested%2Fhierarchical_tags_work%3F_How_can_I_manage_multiple_projects_with_them%3F), and allows one to group tags by projects and contexts. you may use the `Replace All` command to rename your existing tags and turn them into nested tags.
        - example: when date tagging using the following format `#2024/07/13`, searching for `#2024` will return all dates from 2024, and searching for `#2024/07` will return all dates from July 2024.
- new commands
    - show / hide panel sections (tag ranges, note mentions, results filters) by right-clicking anywhere on the panel.
    - edit tags also by right-clicking on the tag list or the search query.
- new settings
    - `Search: When multiple tags are matched, select`: "First" / "All" (behaviour in v0.8.0) / "None" (behaviour before v0.8.0).
        - example: when selecting "All" here, and selecting `Search: Use regex for tag / note / content filtering`, you could come up with filter patterns to add multiple tags at once to the query and search for all of them.
    - `Search: Tag sort by`: "Name" / "Count".
        - example: when selecting "Count" here and "First" in the setting above, the most popular tag will be selected by default when pressing Enter in the query builder.
- misc fixes
    - toggle checklist items with markdown formatting.
    - case insensitive tag ranges.
    - case insensitive tag replace / remove all.
    - checkbox style.
